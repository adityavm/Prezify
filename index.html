		<li>It is an ancient Mariner,<br/>
		And he stoppeth one of three.<br/>
		`By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br/>
		Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?</div></li>

		<li>The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<br/>
		And I am next of kin;<br/>
		The guests are met, the feast is set:<br/>
		Mayst hear the merry din.'</li>

		<li>He holds him with his skinny hand,<br/>
		"There was a ship," quoth he.<br/>
		`Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'<br/>
		Eftsoons his hand dropped he.</li>

		<li>He holds him with his glittering eye - <br/>
		The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br/>
		And listens like a three years' child:<br/>
		The Mariner hath his will.</li>

		<li>The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<br/>
		He cannot choose but hear;<br/>
		And thus spake on that ancient man,<br/>
		The bright-eyed Mariner.</li>

		<li>"The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br/>
		Merrily did we drop<br/>
		Below the kirk, below the hill,<br/>
		Below the lighthouse top.</li>

		<li>The sun came up upon the left,<br/>
		Out of the sea came he!<br/>
		And he shone bright, and on the right<br/>
		Went down into the sea.</li>

		<li>Higher and higher every day,<br/>
		Till over the mast at noon -"<br/>
		The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br/>
		For he heard the loud bassoon.</li>

		<li>The bride hath paced into the hall,<br/>
		Red as a rose is she;<br/>
		Nodding their heads before her goes<br/>
		The merry minstrelsy.</li>

		<li>The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br/>
		Yet he cannot choose but hear;<br/>
		And thus spake on that ancient man,<br/>
		The bright-eyed Mariner.</li>

		<li>"And now the storm-blast came, and he<br/>
		Was tyrannous and strong:<br/>
		He struck with his o'ertaking wings,<br/>
		And chased us south along.</li>

		<li>With sloping masts and dipping prow,<br/>
		As who pursued with yell and blow<br/>
		Still treads the shadow of his foe,<br/>
		And foward bends his head,<br/>
		The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<br/>
		And southward aye we fled.</li>

		<li>And now there came both mist and snow,<br/>
		And it grew wondrous cold:<br/>
		And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br/>
		As green as emerald.</li>

		<li>And through the drifts the snowy clifts<br/>
		Did send a dismal sheen:<br/>
		Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken - <br/>
		The ice was all between.</li>

		<li>The ice was here, the ice was there,<br/>
		The ice was all around:<br/>
		It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br/>
		Like noises in a swound!</li>

		<li>At length did cross an Albatross,<br/>
		Thorough the fog it came;<br/>
		As it had been a Christian soul,<br/>
		We hailed it in God's name.</li>

		<li>It ate the food it ne'er had eat,<br/>
		And round and round it flew.<br/>
		The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br/>
		The helmsman steered us through!</li>

		<li>And a good south wind sprung up behind;<br/>
		The Albatross did follow,<br/>
		And every day, for food or play,<br/>
		Came to the mariner's hollo!</li>

		<li>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br/>
		It perched for vespers nine;<br/>
		Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br/>
		Glimmered the white moonshine."</li>

		<li>'God save thee, ancient Mariner,<br/>
		From the fiends that plague thee thus! - <br/>
		Why look'st thou so?' -"With my crossbow<br/>
		I shot the Albatross."</li>
